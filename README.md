DCFC: Derby County Football Club

INTRODUCTION
This project uses HTML/CSS/SCSS to produce a static website about Derby County
Football Club, a soccer team in England.

WEB PAGES
There are four pages about the team: club history (home page), star players, club honours and club rivals. The information has been gathered from the internet, 'The Book of Derby County', Breedon Books, 1994, and the images from
Unsplash.

FILES
There are five files:

1) index.html: This contains the home page information. The navigation bar is a
component from Bootstrap. There is one image with a caption, text and an unordered list.

2) players.html: This contains the information about star players. It has the same navigation bar. It is structured as two columns making use of Bootstrap Grid model. It contains several images with captions plus text.

3) honours.html: This contains the club honours information. It has a navigation bar. It has a background image with text over the top and an ordered list.

4) rivals.html: This contains information about the club rivals. It has the same navigation bar. It has a table of historical results against Nottingham Forest FC.

5) styles0.scss: This file contains CSS and SCSS to style all the HTML files.

It has SCSS to determine the navigation bar background colour which is different on each page, font weight of the unordered and ordered lists and font colour of the ordered list.

Next, CSS is used to set up a media query to alter the page heading for smaller screens, it provides the caption style for images and table, sets up the background image on the honours page and styles the table on the rivals page.
